It is unlikely that you can simply host legacy applications using AWS Lambda.
You cannot host legacy application code in an S3 static website, only static content is possible.

AWS Artifact is your go-to, central resource for compliance-related information that matters to you. It provides on-demand access to AWS’ security and compliance reports and select online agreements.

You cannot create IAM users in different Regions as the IAM service is a global service.

AWS Trusted Advisor is an online tool that provides you real time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.
"AWS Health Dashboard" is incorrect. The  health dashboard shows issues or upcoming events that may impact your resources. It does not notify of service limit breaches.
"Amazon RDS" is a managed SQL database and has nothing to do with service limits generally.
Cost Explorer is used for viewing costs and will not assist with service limits.

Cost allocation tags can be used to tag and categorize your resources and then run view the billing in Cost Explorer and the cost allocation report. For example you can tag your resources by department or project and then view costs attributed to the resources used by those groups. ou do not need to split your usage across multiple accounts, you can instead use cost allocation tags.
 "AWS Trusted Advisor" advises you on best practices for provisioning resources.
Consolidated billing will give you usage per account but not per project.

AWS does not secure your applications.
You have no say in what hardware AWS utilize.
You cannot access the AWS data centers.

Amazon WorkSpaces is a managed, secure Desktop-as-a-Service (DaaS) solution.

Amazon MSK (Managed Streaming for Kafka) is the correct choice as it is a fully managed service that facilitates building and running applications built on Apache Kafka without having to manage the underlying infrastructure. It would allow the financial services firm to focus on building their analytics platform without being concerned about Kafka’s infrastructure management, hence reducing the operational overhead.
"Amazon SQS" is a message queue service used to decouple the components of a cloud application, not suited for setting up and managing a real-time analytics platform based on Apache Kafka.
 Amazon Kinesis is used for real-time streaming data and can technically be used to build a real-time analytics solution, but still it is not the best option when the requirement specifically mentions leveraging Apache Kafka. Kinesis has its own streaming data solution that is separate from Kafka.
"Amazon Redshift" is a data warehousing service designed to work with business intelligence tools for analytical reporting, and it does not offer Apache Kafka as a service, which is what is needed for real-time analytics in this scenario.

AWS provide SDKs for various programming languages and these can be used for integrating the features of AWS services directly into an application.
The AWS CLI is used for running commands but is not the best tool for integrating features of AWS services directly into an application.
CodeDeploy is used for deploying code from a code repository and actually installing the application.
CodePipeline is used for automating the code release lifecycle.

Amazon Elastic File System - EFS volumes cannot be used for the root storage volume but can be mounted to store data.

Using a firewall with AWS resources is recommended to reduce the attack surface of your services which can mitigate some DDoS attacks.
"Amazon CloudWatch" is for performance monitoring and will not protect against DDoS.
"AWS CloudTrail" does Logging API calls and so will not protect against DDoS.
The AWS Health dashboard is not useful for monitoring and will not protect against DDoS.

According to the shared responsibility model, AWS is responsible to the management of all AWS global infrastructure components including Regions, Availability Zones, Edge locations, Regional Edge Caches, and Local Zones.
Applications are deployed by customers, not AWS.
Patch management is a shared responsibility. Customers must patch instances databases running on EC2 and AWS will patch the underlying infrastructure and some managed services.
Customers are responsible for implementing access controls for their data.

Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK).

Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY).
Like a user name and password, you must use both the access key ID and secret access key together to authenticate your requests.
An IAM user name and password can be used for console access but cannot be used with the CLI or API.

Loose coupling is when you break systems down into smaller components that are loosely coupled together. This reduces interdependencies between systems components. This is achieved in the cloud using messages buses, notification and messaging services.
Removing single points of failure ensures fault tolerance and high availability. This is easily achieved in the cloud as the architecture and features of the cloud support the implementation of highly available and fault tolerant systems.

There are 5 pillars and under the operational excellence pillar the following best practices are recommended:
• Perform operations as code
• Make frequent, small, reversible changes
• Refine operations procedures frequently
• Anticipate failure
• Learn from all operational failures

AWS WAF can be used to protect on-premises resources if they are deployed behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). In this scenario the on-premises website servers are added to a target group by IP address. The ALB has a WAF WebACL attached to it and distributes connections to the on-premises website.
A route table cannot be used for protecting resources running outside AWS.
Security groups can only be attached to EC2 instances.
Network ACLs only filter traffic entering and leaving a VPC subnet.

Enabling encryption for data at rest is definitely a good practice and data in transit should also be encrypted where possible as well. It is also a good practice to limit access privileges according to the principal of least privilege. This means limiting privileges to those required to perform a specific role.

Amazon OpenSearch Service is designed to set up, manage, and scale search and analytics solutions, providing the necessary functionalities to efficiently find articles based on different criteria.
Amazon SQS is a message queuing service used to decouple the components of a cloud application
AWS Lambda is mainly used to run code in response to events and automatically manage the computing fleet.
Amazon EC2 is used to host applications and can technically host a web application

An Amazon VPC includes multiple Availability Zones. Within a VPC you can create subnets in each AZ that is available in the Region and distribute your resources across these subnets for high availability.
A VPC cannot include multiple Regions. A VPC cannot include multiple Edge locations as these are independent of the Regions in which a VPC is created. You can only attach one Internet gateway to each VPC.

The most efficient option is to use multiple EC2 instances and distribute the workload across them. This is an example of horizontal scaling and will allow the workload to keep growing in size without any issue and without increasing the overall processing timeframe.
"Run the batch job on a larger Amazon EC2 instance type with more CPU" may help initially but over time this will not scale well and the workload will take many days to complete.
"Change the Amazon EC2 volume type to a Provisioned IOPS SSD volume" This will improve the underlying performance of the EBS volume but does not assist with processing (more CPU is needed, i.e. by spreading across instances).
Bare metal instances are used for workloads that require access to the hardware feature set (such as Intel VT-x), for applications that need to run in non-virtualized environments for licensing or support requirements, or for customers who wish to use their own hypervisor.

The Principal element specifies the user, account, service, or other entity that is allowed or denied access to a resource. 
Actions are the permissions that you can specify in a policy.
Resources are the ARNs of resources you wish to specify permissions for.
Conditions define certain conditions to apply when granting permissions such as the source IP address of the caller.

"Patching database software" and "Taking a backup of a database"is taken care of by aws/
AWS does not audit your source code. You can use Amazon CodeGuru for recommendations for improvement though.
AWS does not create your schema; this is something that’s in the customer’s control.
AWS does not perform any security testing of your applications.

A convertible reserved instance enables you to exchange one or more Convertible Reserved Instances for another Convertible Reserved Instance with a different configuration, including instance family, operating system, and tenancy.
With standard RIs you cannot change the instance type but you can change the instance size.
Regional RIs apply to instance usage within any AZ in a specified Region.

Athena is used for querying data in Amazon S3 using SQL.
DocumentDB is a NoSQL database that supports document data structures.

The ability to quickly provision resources on AWS is a good example of speed and agility. On AWS the resources are readily available and can be deployed extremely quickly. Scalable compute capacity is another example as it gives you the agility to easily reconfigure your resources with more or less capacity as is required.

AWS are responsible for updating firmware on the physical Amazon EC2 host servers. Customers are then responsible for any patching of the EC2 operating system and any installed software.
"Configuring network ACLs to block malicious attacks", "Patching software running on Amazon EC2 instances", and "Updating security group rules to enable connectivity" are customer responsibilities.

Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK).
You use a user name and password for the management console.
SSL/TLS certificates are used for creating encrypted channels using HTTPS.

An Amazon Machine Image (AMI) provides the information required to launch an instance. You must specify an AMI when you launch an instance. You can launch multiple instances from a single AMI when you need multiple instances with the same configuration. You can use different AMIs to launch instances when you need instances with different configurations.
EBS is block-based storage for EC2.
AWS Systems Manager gives you visibility and control of your infrastructure on AWS.
Amazon AppStream 2.0 is a fully managed non-persistent application and desktop streaming service.

The Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) offers virtually unlimited storage. The total volume of data and number of objects you can store are unlimited. Individual Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes. The largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes

A company is migrating a monolithic application that does not scale well into the cloud and refactoring it into a microservices architecture.
A microservices architecture will help ensure that each component of the application can scale independently and be updated independently. Loose coupling further assists as it places reduces the dependencies between systems and ensures that messages and data being passed between application components can be reliably and durably stored.

The company should create cost allocation tags that specify the department and assign them to resources. These tags must be activated so they are visible in the cost allocation report. Once this is done and a monthly cost allocation report has been configured it will be easy to monitor the costs for each department.
Cost explorer will not show a breakdown of the costs by department.
A billing alert simply lets you know you have reached a cost threshold.
This will not help as billing is not broken out by VPC so they will not be able to determine the costs per department using this method.

An Amazon Relational Database Service (RDS) deployment across multiple availability zones is a good example of using the reliability pillar of the AWS Well-Architected Framework.
"Amazon EBS provisioned IOPS volume" - an example of performance efficiency.
"Attach a WebACL to a CloudFront distribution" - an example of using the security pillar.
"Use CloudFormation to deploy infrastructure" - an example of using the operational excellence pillar.

The cost management tools do not integrate with the tools used to launch EC2 instances and cannot choose the best pricing plan.
This is performed using lifecycle management in Amazon S3, it is not a task performed by cost management tools.

A self-managed relational database can be installed on Amazon EC2. When using this deployment you can choose the operating system and instance type that suits your needs and then install and manage any database software you require.
RedShift is managed data warehouse solution and is better suited to use cases where analytics of data is required.
ElastiCache is a managed service for in-memory, high-performance caching of database content.
DynamoDB is a non-relational (NoSQL) type of database.

To make the deployment highly available the user should launch the instances across multiple Availability Zones in a single AWS Region. Elastic Load Balancers can only serve targets in a single Region so it is not possible to deploy across Regions.
The pricing model is not relevant to high availability and deploying in a single AZ does not result in a highly available deployment.
You cannot use an ELB with instances in multiple Regions and using an EIP does not help.
Using reserved instances may not be appropriate as we do not know whether this is going to be a long-term workload or not.

Amazon EC2 is an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) solution. This means the underlying hardware and software layer for running a virtual server are managed for you. 
AWS Lambda, AWS Fargate and Amazon DynamoDB are serverless and you do not need to manage patches.

You do not outsource all operational risk; you still have to manage risk for the applications you run on AWS.
You don’t have any control over data center infrastructure in the AWS Cloud.
You must still develop your own applications on the AWS Cloud.

Scheduled scaling helps you to set up your own scaling schedule according to predictable load changes.
Predictive scaling uses daily and weekly trends to determine when to scale. In this case the Cloud Practitioner knows about the event that will require more resources.
This policy will cause the ASG to attempt to keep resource utilization at the target value.
Step scaling will launch resources in response to demand, this will not ensure the resource are ready at the right time as there will be a delay.
