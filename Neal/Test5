You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files from Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (Amazon EC2) instances, AWS CloudTrail, Route 53, and other sources. You can then retrieve the associated log data from CloudWatch Logs.
AWS CloudTrail is used for recording a history of API actions taken on your account.
OpsWorks is a configuration management service.
Amazon Kinesis is a set of services used for collecting, processing and analyzing streaming data.

Where possible, you should replace EC2 workloads with AWS managed services that don’t require you to take any capacity decisions. AWS Lambda is a serverless services and you only pay for actual processing time. Other examples of services that you don’t need to make capacity decisions with include: ELB, CloudFront, SQS, Kinesis Firehose, SES, and CloudSearch.
Deploying resources with CloudFormation is great for consistently deploying application configurations from a template. However, this is not an example of cost optimization

Amazon Elastic Load Balancing is used to spread load and introduce fault tolerance by distributing connections across multiple identically configured back-end EC2 instances.
Amazon CloudFront is a content delivery network that is used for caching content and serving it to web-based users quickly.
Amazon ElastiCache is an in-memory database cache and is used to introduce improved performance rather than fault tolerance.
DynamoDB is fault tolerant; however, it is not something you add to an architecture to introduce fault tolerance to the application stack.

Access keys are long-term credentials for an IAM user or the AWS account root user. You can use access keys to sign programmatic requests to the AWS CLI or AWS API (directly or using the AWS SDK).
Access keys consist of two parts: an access key ID (for example, AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE) and a secret access key (for example, wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY).

With cloud computing you no longer need to guess about capacity as you can elastically scale. This means you don’t end up overprovisioning but instead react to the load on your servers. You can also be faster and more agile with development and release of applications.
AWS runs the infrastructure but you still manage the application. You still need to patch your own operating systems.  The cloud is centralized so you won’t necessarily bring services closer to your end users.

With AWS Lambda you don’t have any servers to manage (serverless). Lambda functions scale out rather than up running multiple invocations of the function in parallel.
AWS Lambda is strictly AWS proprietary not any open source software...

Elastic IP addresses are for use in a specific region only and can therefore only be remapped between instances within that region. You can use Elastic IP addresses to mask the failure of an instance in one Availability Zone by rapidly remapping the address to an instance in another Availability Zone.
Edge Locations are used by CloudFront and are not places where you can run EC2 instances.
DB subnets (groups) are used by the RDS relational database service and are not used for running EC2 instances.

Cross-Region replication (CRR) is used to copy objects across Amazon S3 buckets in different AWS Regions. The only option here that will help is to use CRR to copy the data to another region. This will provide disaster recovery.
Moving to Glacier, or also to another S3 storage class does not copy the data out of the region.


Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2, so that you get the flexibility and cost effectiveness of using your own licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity and elasticity of AWS.

A Network ACL is a firewall that is associated with a subnet within your VPC. It is used to filter the network traffic that enters and exits the subnet.
A Security Group is a firewall that is associated with an EC2 instances (not the subnet). Security Groups control the traffic the inbound and outbound network traffic from/to the instance.
An IAM Policy is used to assign permissions to users and roles. A Bucket Policy is used with Amazon S3 buckets to control access.

AWS CloudFormation is a service that gives developers and businesses an easy way to create a collection of related AWS resources and provision them in an orderly and predictable fashion. AWS CloudFormation provides a common language for you to describe and provision all the infrastructure resources in your cloud environment.

AWS Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) integrates with AWS Firewall Manager and you can manage it using Firewall Manager, by itself it is not a centralized solution to manage firewall rules across various AWS accounts and VPCs.
AWS Firewall Manager allows you to centrally configure and manage firewall rules across your accounts and applications in AWS Organization, helping to set up AWS WAF, AWS Shield Advanced, and AWS Network Firewall rules. AWS Network Firewall is a managed service that makes it easy to deploy essential network protections for all your Amazon VPCs.

Using IAM roles instead of storing credentials within EC2 instances is more secure It is also easier to manage roles.
You cannot apply multiple roles to a single instance. Role credentials are temporary, not permanent, and are rotated automatically.

AWS Lambda is a compute service for running code as functions.
Amazon LightSail is a compute service for running instances.
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS) is a message bus for temporarily storing data that is being passed between application components.

You can restore an Amazon RDS database instance to a specific point in time with a granularity of 5 minutes. Amazon RDS uses transaction logs which it uploads to Amazon S3 to do this.
Incremental backup describes taking a backup of items that have changed since the last backup.

The TCO calculator asks for the number of servers (Physical or VMs) you are running on-premises. You also need to supply the resource information (CPU, RAM) and specify whether the server is a DB or non-DB.
You don’t need to specify the number of storage systems, you just need to specify the raw capacity.

Amazon Web Services Web Application Firewall (AWS WAF) is used for protecting web applications and APIs against malicious attacks. 
Amazon GuardDuty is used for continuously monitoring AWS resources for threats. It is not a DDoS prevention service, it uses machine learning and anomaly detection to identify security vulnerabilities in resources.

When you deploy an application across multiple Availability Zones the application can be considered to be highly available. You must also have a way of directing traffic to the application in each AZ such as an Elastic Load Balancer.
Deploying applications into different regions results daving global reach.

Amazon ElastiCache is also an in-memory cache but it is not a feature of DynamoDB.


Amazon EBS encryption offers a straight-forward encryption solution for your EBS resources that doesn't require you to build, maintain, and secure your own key management infrastructure. 
It uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) customer master keys (CMK) when creating encrypted volumes and snapshots.
Encryption operations occur on the servers that host EC2 instances, ensuring the security of both data-at-rest and data-in-transit between an instance and its attached EBS storage.
All volumes (including root and non-root) can now be encrypted at launch time and it’s possible to set this as the default setting.

Replication enables automatic, asynchronous copying of objects across Amazon S3 buckets. Buckets that are configured for object replication can be owned by the same AWS account or by different accounts. You can copy objects between different AWS Regions or within the same Region.
Both source and destination buckets must have versioning enabled.

AWS provide volume based discount so that when you use more services you reduce the cost per service. 
You can also reserve capacity by locking in to fixed 1 or 3 year contracts to get significant discounts
You never pay for inbound data transfer
You don’t get discounts for using a variety of services, only when you use more services
There are never termination fees with AWS

There are five design principles for reliability in the cloud:
• Test recovery procedures
• Automatically recover from failure
• Scale horizontally to increase aggregate system availability
• Stop guessing capacity
• Manage change in automation

With AWS organizations you create a paying account and linked accounts. One bill is provided for multiple accounts within an organization. Volume pricing discounts can be applied across resources in multiple accounts.
one bill is provided for multiple accounts within an organization. CloudTrail is on a per account basis and per region basis but can be aggregated into a single bucket in the paying account.

With the Developer plan you can open unlimited cases. You can also open unlimited cases with the Business and Enterprise plans but these are more expensive. You cannot open any support cases with the basic support plan.

Amazon FSx is the correct answer because it offers fully managed third-party file systems, including Windows File Server and Lustre, giving users native compatibility and a feature-rich experience, thereby facilitating the use of these file systems with a wide variety of AWS services.
