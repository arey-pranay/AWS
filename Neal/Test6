You should deploy your EC2 instances across different AZs within a VPC so that if a single data center fails you still have instances available.

To manage your objects so that they are stored cost effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their Amazon S3 Lifecycle. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions:
• Transition actions—Define when objects transition to another storage class.
• Expiration actions—Define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf. The lifecycle expiration costs depend on when you choose to expire objects.

Object sharing refers to the ability to make any object publicly available via a URL.
Bucket policies are used for controlling access to buckets, they can’t be used to move data between storage classes.
Versioning enabled you to automatically keep multiple versions of an object (when enabled).

Amazon EC2 Spot Instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud. 
Spot Instances are available at up to a 90% discount compared to On-Demand prices.
