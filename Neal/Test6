AWS Config can be used to track the configuration state of your resources and how the state has changed over time.
With CloudTrail you can audit who made what API calls on what resources at what time. This can help with identifying changes that cause reliability issues.

You can back up the data on your Amazon EBS volumes to Amazon S3 by taking point-in-time snapshots.
