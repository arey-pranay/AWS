AWS Organizations offers Service control policies (SCPs) which are a type of organization policy that you can use to manage permissions in your organization.
AWS IAM is used for assigning permissions but SCPs in AWS Organizations are used to control which API actions are allowed in an account.

AWS Elastic Beanstalk and AWS CloudFormation are both examples of automation. Beanstalk is a platform service that leverages the automation capabilities of CloudFormation to build out application architectures.
Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) is used for distributing incoming connections to Amazon EC2 instances. 
AWS Lambda is a compute service, not an automation service.

Amazon Cognito lets you add user sign-up, sign-in, and access control to your web and mobile apps quickly and easily. Amazon Cognito scales to millions of users and supports sign-in with social identity providers, such as Apple, Facebook, Google, and Amazon, and enterprise identity providers via SAML 2.0 and OpenID Connect.
AWS Single Sign-On (AWS SSO) is where you create, or connect, your workforce identities in AWS once and manage access centrally across your AWS organization and doesnâ€™t use SAML.
