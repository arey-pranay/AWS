Reserved instances allow a customer to use on-demand EC2 instances at a discounted price based on a commitment of usage.
On-demand instances are the most expensive, and the default billing option for EC2 instances.
Spot Instances are not suitable as spot instances let you take advantage of unused EC2 capacity in the AWS cloud, which can be terminated at a 2-minute notice if AWS requires the capacity for on-demand customers.

Consolidated billing has the following benefits:
• One bill – You get one bill for multiple accounts.
• Easy tracking – You can track the charges across multiple accounts and download the combined cost and usage data.
• Combined usage – You can combine the usage across all accounts in the organization to share the volume pricing discounts, Reserved Instance discounts, and Savings Plans. This can result in a lower charge for your project, department, or company than with individual standalone accounts.
• No extra fee – Consolidated billing is offered at no additional cost.

Service control policies (SCPs) are used for controlling the API actions you can use, not for lowering costs.
