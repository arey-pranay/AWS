To manage your objects so that they are stored cost-effectively throughout their lifecycle, configure their Amazon S3 Lifecycle. An S3 Lifecycle configuration is a set of rules that define actions that Amazon S3 applies to a group of objects. There are two types of actions: Transition actions (define when objects transition to another storage class) and expiration actions (define when objects expire. Amazon S3 deletes expired objects on your behalf).

AWS Pricing Calculator compares the cost of your applications in an on-premises or traditional hosting environment to AWS: server, storage, network, and IT labor. Therefore, you need to include every element relevant to these points of comparison.
Server administration is included in the IT labor costs.
Power/Cooling are included in the server, storage, and network cost.
