An On-Demand Instance is an instance that you use on-demand. You have full control over its lifecycle â€” you decide when to launch, stop, hibernate, start, reboot, or terminate it. There is no long-term commitment required when you purchase On-Demand Instances. There is no upfront payment and you pay only for the seconds that your On-Demand Instances are running.
There is no need for a long-term purchasing commitment. The price per second for running an On-Demand Instance is fixed. On-demand instances cannot be interrupted. Therefore On-Demand instances are the best fit for short-term, spiky and critical workloads.

A Spot Instance is an unused EC2 instance that is available for less than the On-Demand price. Because Spot Instances enable you to request unused EC2 instances at steep discounts (up to 90%), you can lower your Amazon EC2 costs significantly. 
Spot Instances are well-suited for data analysis, batch jobs, background processing, and other flexible tasks that can be interrupted. These can be terminated at short notice, so these are not suitable for critical workloads that need to run at a specific point in time.

Reserved Instances (RI) provide you with significant savings (up to 75%) on your Amazon EC2 costs compared to On-Demand Instance pricing. Reserved Instances (RI) are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account.
You can purchase a Reserved Instance (RI) for a one-year or three-year commitment, with the three-year commitment offering a bigger discount. Reserved instances (RI) cannot be interrupted. Reserved instances (RI) are not the right choice for short-term workloads.

Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts allow you to use your eligible software licenses from vendors such as Microsoft and Oracle on Amazon EC2 so that you get the flexibility and cost-effectiveness of using your licenses, but with the resiliency, simplicity, and elasticity of AWS.
An Amazon EC2 Dedicated Host is a physical server fully dedicated for your use, so you can help address corporate compliance requirement. They're not cost-efficient compared to On-Demand instances.

AWS Shield is a managed service that protects against Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks for applications running on AWS. AWS Shield Standard is enabled for all AWS customers at no additional cost. AWS Shield Standard automatically protects your web applications running on AWS against the most common, frequently occurring DDoS attacks.
You can get the full benefits of AWS Shield Standard by following the best practices of DDoS resiliency on AWS. As AWS Shield Standard is automatically activated for all AWS customers with no options for any customizations, therefore AWS needs to manage the maintenance and configurations for this service. Hence this service falls under the purview of AWS.
