The AWS Cost & Usage Report (AWS CUR) contains the most comprehensive set of AWS cost and usage data available

An instance store provides temporary block-level storage for your instance. This storage is located on disks that are physically attached to the host computer. 
This is a good option when you need storage with very low latency, but you don't need the data to persist when the instance terminates or you can take advantage of fault-tolerant architectures.

EFS, EBS and S3 are NOT available as a hardware disk on the instance.

A VPC endpoint enables you to privately connect your VPC to supported AWS services and VPC endpoint services powered by AWS PrivateLink without requiring an internet gateway, NAT device, VPN connection, or AWS Direct Connect connection. 

There are two types of VPC endpoints: interface endpoints and gateway endpoints.
Amazon DynamoDB only support VPC gateway endpoint. 
All other services that support VPC Endpoints use a VPC interface endpoint.
S3 supports both endpoints.

When you provision a Multi-AZ DB Instance, Amazon RDS automatically creates a primary DB Instance and synchronously replicates the data to a standby instance in a different Availability Zone (AZ).
In case of an infrastructure failure, Amazon RDS performs an automatic failover to the standby (or to a read replica in the case of Amazon Aurora), so that you can resume database operations as soon as the failover is complete.

You cannot deploy only a database via Elastic Beanstalk as its meant for automatic application deployment when you upload your code.
For RDS, Read replicas allow you to create read-only copies that are synchronized with your master database. There is no standby available while using read replicas.
You can provision the database via CloudFormation for sure, however, it does not provide any automatic recovery in case of a disaster.

A 3 years term would always be more cost-effective than a 1-year term. 
Then within a term, "all upfront" is better than "partial upfront" which in turn is better than "no upfront" from a cost savings perspective.

Each AWS Region consists of a minimum of three Availability Zones (AZ)
Each Availability Zone (AZ) consists of one or more discrete data centers

Amazon S3 Standard-Infrequent Access (S3 Standard-IA) is for data that is accessed less frequently, but requires rapid access when needed.
Amazon S3 Glacier is a secure, durable, and extremely low-cost Amazon S3 cloud storage class for data archiving and long-term backup. S3 Glacier does not support rapid data retrieval, so this option is ruled out.

A scale out operation adds more instances to an existing pool of instances. This implies, there is no single point of failure.
